## SomeContract: A Move Smart Contract

This document explains the functionalities of the Move smart contract named `SomeContract`. 

**Components:**

* **`SomeContract`:** The main contract defining a public struct (`SomeStruct`), variables, and functions.
* **`SomeStruct`:** A public struct containing several string variables with different access levels.
    * **Variables:**
        * `a`: Publicly settable string variable.
        * `b`: Publicly accessible string variable.
        * `c`: Contract-restricted string variable (accessible only by the contract itself).
        * `d`: Self-restricted string variable (accessible only by member functions of the contract).
    * **Functions:**
        * `structFunc()`: A public function defined within the struct itself (marked by "AREA 1").
* **`SomeResource`:** A resource defined within the contract. Resources are similar to structs but manage ownership and can only be accessed by their owners. 
    * **Variable:**
        * `e`: Publicly accessible integer variable.
    * **Function:**
        * `resourceFunc()`: A function associated with the resource (marked by "AREA 2").
* **Public Functions:**
    * `createSomeResource()`: Creates and returns a new instance of the `SomeResource`.
    * `questsAreFun()`: A public function with unspecified behavior (marked by "AREA 3").

**Initialization:**

* The `SomeStruct` is initialized with default values during the contract's `init()` function.
* The `SomeResource` is also initialized with a default value in its own `init()` function.

**Usage:**

1. Deploy the `SomeContract` on the Move VM.
2. Interact with the contract through its public functions:
    * Call `createSomeResource()` to create a new `SomeResource` instance.
    * Execute `questsAreFun()` to potentially perform fun quests.
    * Explore other functionalities based on your specific needs.

**Dependencies:**

* This contract depends on another module named `SomeContract` located at address `0x05`.
